# ItsPronouncedGif

Simple tool for making gifs

Requires dotnet 7.0 runtime to work and it runs (for now) only on windows

After you stop the recording the program may take a moment to process. Once completed, it will create a GIF in the folder where the program is located. The file will be named result.gif.

- Allow to set max FPS
- Better color handling
